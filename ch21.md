# Strategic Planning

If you see the value of strategic planning, you understand the critical value of communication. It starts there. In this respect, the importance of everyone communicating the same understanding of a specific business entity, its goals, and reason to exist (besides making a profit) is crucial.

Before going out on the balcony and reciting your strategic planning ideas to your team, you need to come up with and intelligently articulate such ideas. So, let’s get into it.

It’s sad when I ask a random employee from any business, client, or visitor, what the business is about and they answer, “it’s about [product]” and then I ask how [product] is better than [other product] and they just shrug their shoulders in confusion.

Maybe asking an employee is too much if they don’t have any skin in the game, but some ideas are basic.

Strategic planning is about having a vision, defining a mission, a set of values to guide how to accomplish the mission, and an overarching strategy on how to accomplish the mission and get closer to the vision.

## Vision

The vision is the free part because it enables you to imagine a future you can influence through your business. You must state how this future looks in 10-15 years, so hopefully, your business will still be around in 10-15 years.

Say we are a university, and our vision is to create defining innovative and practical knowledge that will position the university as a leader nationally in technology, humanities, and business, and thus, influence our nation towards a fairer, more competitive, and dynamic economy.

## Mission

Hopefully, our vision has inspired professors, students, investors, and the business community about our purpose. Now they’ll want to know, how will we do that?

The mission will tell them what we are doing to make our vision a reality.

Our mission is to develop students with our study plan that combines leading knowledge from experts in their fields with real-life practice that will develop our students into productive thinkers with a unique set of abilities that help push their chosen fields, and hopefully our nation and the world, forward.

## Values

Values define your version of the work ethics around your mission.

In our university, we value learning from experts involved in their fields, who conduct themselves ethically and can challenge our students to be better than themselves in a collaborative, yet real-life, environment. Our students know how to work together, lead proactively, and execute with integrity like world-class professionals.

## Strategy

It is about your market, offerings, business category, the niche, and your timing.

A great strategy will put a business in a growing category through an uncontested niche so the business can be successful as easily (and affordably) as possible. This is important for all businesses, but critical for new businesses, because the less you have to worry about competition, the faster and more capitalized you can grow and thus, develop your durable competitive advantage. It’s a race of sorts, and the strategy helps see the way. Even established businesses often launch new products and offerings in a less contested market because margins get fatter and juicier; that’s the motivation to innovate and keep close with the several market profiles that compose the entire generic-sounding market.

Let’s finalize the university example.

Our strategy is developing study plans that mix theory with practical studies suited to the modern requirements of growing businesses with a focus on innovative ways of work, technology assistance, and a global perspective, that allows our graduates to join mid to high managerial roles that require timely decision-making to help businesses grow and prosper.

## Communicate Effectively

While it is a good idea to include your strategic planning in all major communications, reminding all stakeholders what your business is all about, it’s also a good idea to create a mantra to remind yourself and others of your strategic planning easily.

In our example, it could be “preparing highly-effective leaders.”

Notice that the mantra is not for leading our marketing efforts, but to summarize the value you generate for stakeholders. For marketing, we have seen far more effective tools such as the Unique Sales Proposition and Big Ideas. A mantra should be short and concise.

In your decision-making, the mantra should help quickly assess if the option is good for you. “Does this help me prepare highly-effective leaders?”

It is important that as a leader you communicate your strategic plan like an obsessed fan and ask people about it (not word by word), so you know they grasp what the business is about.

Now, a list with ten documents that will help guide and harmonize all your strategic communications so the brand voice (which unites all of their members) is consistent:

1. **Brand Style Guide** (also known as Brand Guidelines or Brand Book): This document outlines the visual identity, tone of voice, and messaging framework for the organization's brand. It ensures consistency in branding across all touchpoints, including marketing materials, website, social media, and advertising.
2. **Employee Handbook** (or Staff Handbook): This document outlines the organization's culture, values, policies, and procedures. It covers topics such as code of conduct, work hours, benefits, and performance expectations.
3. **Code of Conduct** (or Ethics Policy): This document outlines the organization's expectations for employee behavior, including ethics, integrity, and professionalism. It may cover topics such as confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and social media use.
4. **Media Relations Policy** (or Media Guidelines): This document outlines the procedures for interacting with the media, including how to handle media inquiries, press releases, and interviews.
5. **Crisis Communications Plan**: This document outlines the procedures for responding to crises, such as natural disasters, product recalls, or reputational issues. It ensures that the organization is prepared to communicate effectively and minimize damage to its reputation.
6. **Social Media Policy**: This document outlines the guidelines for employees' use of social media, including personal and professional accounts. It may cover topics such as confidentiality, intellectual property, and online behavior.
7. **Spokesperson Guidelines**: This document outlines the procedures for designating and preparing spokespersons to represent the organization in media interviews, public appearances, and other external communications.
8. **Communications Strategy** (or Communications Plan): This document outlines the organization's overall communications objectives, target audiences, key messages, and tactics for achieving its communications goals.
9. **Tone of Voice Guidelines**: This document outlines the organization's tone of voice, language, and style for all communications, including marketing materials, website content, and social media.
10. **Style Guide** (also known as Editorial Style Guide): This document outlines the organization's writing style, grammar, and formatting guidelines for all written communications. This includes quotes, press release formats, and communications with your buyers, even if they look improvised, like an email.

You may be creating them as you go, but at least have some minimums established so you can have a basis of behavior. For instance, communicating as if they were your best friend’s mother. This includes how to speak, your tone, keeping the buyer in the loop when there are wait times, smiling, and being courteous.

What’s important is not to overthink when creating your dream company by creating a rule for every possible case, but guidelines that eliminate guesswork, assumptions, and formats to lead to better consistency for the most usual cases, to easily follow through and offer some legal coverage for the company, too.
