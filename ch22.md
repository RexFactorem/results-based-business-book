# Intellectual Capital

When developing your durable competitive advantage, intangible assets are the name of the game. It’s the “secret formula” of Coca-Cola, which is not entirely about the drink, but also their exhaustive knowledge of all consumers in the world (they’re a global brand) and their relentless stewardship that keeps the brand in its leading position.

There’s a saying in boxing that goes, “the hard part is staying on top.” You might get a lucky break and challenge the reigning champion, and probably win. The question then is, how long can you stay up there since you now became the most studied and challenged boxer in your class? You’re the standard to beat. Sometimes a challenger may surpass you, but other times, you won’t be able to keep your own standard and become weaker and less focused.

As your business grows, your intellectual capital becomes more important to defend your position, especially if you want some leadership position in the market. Just look around at the market leaders in each business category you know well, how powerful the brand is, how resourceful their executive team is, and how admired their processes are that give them durable competitive advantages.

Intellectual capital is all protected knowledge, procedures, and processes that enable a company to achieve and defend their durable competitive advantage. This means big profits long-term. A brand is only part of a process. A brand by itself means little if it’s not backed up by a strong team with their respective procedures and processes that help customers achieve their own goals in some different way.

Usually, processes are branded to make them easy to communicate and understand. For example, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola is essentially the process we see in the advertising: an easy-to-get cold and refreshing drink that we can find anywhere, say a beach, a family gathering, or while traveling, that anyone can enjoy, regardless of social status and origin.

You can make an argument that Coca-Cola is not a healthy drink. You’d be right, but that’s beside the point. If we apply black and white ethics to all major consumer and industrial brands, we will always find corporate sins (starting with greed), either with a less-than-ideal product, a less-than-ideal process, a less-than-ideal bargaining power, a less-than-ideal concentration of multiple competitive advantages that promote questionable products, and they’ll just push the blame to the consumer, as they are the ones choosing what to buy and how much. But that’s capitalism. Capitalism is about turning the back to nature because it cannot be patented and somewhat tolerates sustainability because it’s forced to, while putting the highest-converting pricing tag on whatever resources we can uniquely serve. This means that marketing mostly serves a capitalist purpose and will always promote Coca-Cola over natural juice or water filled with minerals near a volcanic site (the best agricultural spots are often near volcanoes because that soil has the most minerals) because Coca-Cola is paying a buck for their ad delivery, and nature doesn’t pay anything nor communicate its own benefits. The Government marginally gets involved, sometimes requiring using canned phrasing like “eat healthy.” If we had a different economic system, one with high ethics, and a Government that’s focused on the well-being of all the people it serves, marketing would serve that interest as well since marketing is only a tool.

Intellectual capital is bound to the efficacy of the team. It’s not relevant to have a recognized brand, efficiently designed processes, and standardized procedures if the people aren’t following the guides, aren't well trained, don’t care to follow them, or aren't managing well.

It’s sad seeing this. I’ll tell you a sad story. Imagine a well-established mass-market brand of alcoholic beverages. In the past, they franchised distribution centers with exclusive rights to a certain area coverage within the city. The franchisee then goes, sells, and distributes to any and every established business that benefits from their products, like convenience stores, restaurants, bars, and supermarkets. It’s a nice business to manage because, given you do your homework, money pours in constantly. The franchisee, a father, eventually gets old and inherits his distribution center to his daughter and two sons. The siblings get comfortable as they always were. They travel, buy nice cars, have big houses, live very comfortable lives, especially one, who barely ever went to the business to see what’s going on, or the daughter who married a playboy husband who only cared for his Corvette and his perfect hair. The one who ran the business did it from his high horse without much common sense. They get greedy, too. They stop managing the business effectively like their father did. Problems arose like they stop giving constant maintenance to the trucks, making them slower, with some completely out of service. They stopped keeping close contact with their clients because they’re just commoners or something like that to them. They allowed company culture to be toxic, filled with petty theft, supervisors having unchecked power because “they are friends with the brothers,” and inflating invoices to get a cut, and the combination of these issues starts cascading into inefficient deliveries and problems, ultimately meaning less sales. They got so comfortable that the main brand headquarters takes notice through data analytics. Sales are low in an area between other areas who have always had high numbers. Something is very wrong. They evaluate the situation and decide to sue for breaching of contract. There are many issues, including bad image for the brand and not complying with all the agreements of maintaining their operations efficient, hurting the brand. Now the end of the story. This family loses their franchise rights and sells the distribution center back to the brand for cheap, and headquarters flip it almost overnight. They are well capitalized. They buy new trucks, start marketing aggressively, and even create a few convenient stores of their own around filled with many of their brands that move product like crazy. The change was noticeable from a mile away. The family couldn’t keep up their lifestyle and had to sell a lot of their estate, living like the middle class they didn’t want to get too much involved with when they were very rich.

This management turnover was so amazing because of the strong intellectual capital of this brand. Their accumulated experience, knowledge of the market, knowing who to call, knowing who to hire, giving good training, following procedure, and keeping a close eye on performance is what makes the brand. It’s as important as having a strong reputation that helps land business like ripe fruits raining from a tree on their own, non-stop.

Think about it. It’s not about having money and buying assets, but every decision made, no matter its level, it’s communication and receptiveness, and overall, having the right attitude that allows the business to reach its strategic goals.

Now we’ll see some guidelines to manage your intellectual capital and focus it towards executing your strategic planning.
