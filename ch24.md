# Strategy + Ideals

As much as I’d like a utopia where you can be yourself, noble, transparent, and good things will happen to you and your business, real life in capitalism doesn’t work that way. Business borrows many of its principles from war principles. For instance, it’s not uncommon to see a successful businessperson cite Sun-Tzu’s _The Art of War_, or Miyamoto Musashi’s _The Book of Five Rings_, or a more modern Clausewitz’s _On War_, where he explains strategy as coming from the Greek _strategia_ – a compound of _stratos_, meaning “army,” and _agein_, meaning “to lead.” In commerce, as in war, you need to manage conflict, what we call negotiation, and the competitive advantage powers that set up our tone and influence how we approach such “conflict.” You want to sell as expensively as possible, the buyer wants to buy as affordably as possible, and you need to find some middle ground that leads to profits and repeat customers.

Strategy is a sexy term for a boring-sounding “long-term planning,” which has also taken a few colors and ideas from military thought-leaders. In this sense, we must distinguish strategy from planning, as planning is static and strategy is dynamic. When you make a plan, you make it taking some assumptions about how the environment will respond. But with strategy, you need to adapt as competition responds, based on a doctrine built on your strengths and your competitive advantages. Strategy is “battle-dependent,” including choosing your battles and the famous Sun-Tzu’s idea of choosing battles you’ve already won, while tactics (also a term borrowed from war theory) are how you use your resources to win the battle.

War theory emphasizes the importance of simplicity in strategy. Strategy needs to be communicated, and you don’t want the idea to distort as your team repeats it. Strategy also needs a sense of morale, since wars are ultimately won by those who can bend the spirit of the opposing army. This basically means you win the negotiation and the buyer accepts your price. The morale comes from the act you put together to impose upon them. For instance, a salesperson can show they’re a busy and blunt individual who doesn’t care if you buy, but if you want the product, you should decide now. These are the terms, and here’s what I’ve got for you after you told me X and Y objections.

The salesperson can be an honest, noble, and transparent person at heart, but in order to win at sales, they need to be a pushing, enthusiastic, and alluring individual who can hide the fact they’re a person and present themselves as someone there to assess, present, and help you decide, right now. This is a common strategy to win the most battles in sales. This is the doctrine. A cunning salesperson can skip all the aimless small talk at the beginning and get the gears flowing towards a productive conversation right from the start by framing the conversation. For example, “What a timely call, I just got from the plant and got a new batch of X available for immediate delivery. What are you thinking of getting? Let me see if I can accelerate shipping more than our usual wait times.”

The salesperson needs to take their personal baggage, like having a crappy day and an annoying spouse, and put it in a closet. Then wear a smile and focus on the sales day. The buyer doesn’t care about that, and worse, the sales conversation can get toxic if negativity is sensed from the salesperson, losing the sale. Also, the buyer can be cunning and use this in their favor, winning the battle against the salesperson by acting as a victim to the negativity of the salesperson. They don’t care for you as much as you think. In business, they are all after their own self-interest. And this is a strong tool to use and win, showing you take their self-interest at heart.

Strategy is knowing how to decide the framework (approach) you’re using to win a particular business situation. Maybe a problem can be solved by changing distributors, or maybe a new product is needed to help monetize further highly active buyers. Tactics are deciding how you are doing it, maybe through a website, or a social media campaign, or having a strong lead campaign from websites, but letting professional closers seal the deal for your high-ticket offers.

And then there are ideals.

We touched on them briefly already above when speaking of a sense of morale, bending the spirit of the opposing side, and having enthusiasm. They’re the low-hanging fruits of your ideals.

Ideals are the energy that you inject into your actions and words. This energy comes from your beliefs, both your core human beliefs and the beliefs around your job. If you believe that your product and offers help make the world better by improving people’s lives, it’s only natural that your spirit will be a force to reckon with and can bend the other side's spirit to play to your tune.

Honest and evil leaders all have their ideals. So do corrupt and honest businesses. There are false and true ideals one chooses to believe, either by one’s upbringing or how we rationalize and deal with life. “If you want to win in business, you need to be a shark. Eat or be eaten,” is a common ideal from an active, intense, and competitive business environment.

In a movie, ideals are injected when a mentor teaches the rookie how “the world works” and how to win the game. It doesn’t matter if it’s a business movie, baseball, heist, or a James Bond movie. If the rookie wants to win, they’ll refine their own methods and harmonize the outside “rules” with their “inside” rules. This is so basic that nearly all movies show this transformation, from a fool who isn’t winning, adapting, or doesn’t know, to the cunning, winning, and adapting expert. Sometimes there’s the luck factor, which we cannot ignore. Most billionaires who talk about their riches acknowledge how important luck is to their story. Where preparation meets opportunity, but sometimes the opportunity is so great and magnetic that it overshadows one’s preparation, challenging their adaptation and rising to a level where they can take full advantage of the opportunity. Such as Bill Gates selling an operating system to IBM when he didn’t have one. Or Steve Jobs having a “cheat code” by seeing another company’s unlaunched innovations and then finding a way to make them work.

Ideals fill the gap, when there is one, between strategy and opportunity. They can bridge either. But they can also elevate either to a new level or push it down.

You can see people who have a business at a great location and with great offerings, only to not advertise because their strategy is all based on word-of-mouth efforts. This greatly limits the amount of success a business can achieve. Some of these people fail to strategize effective selling efforts because they have an ideal of “advertising is only for bad products; good products sell themselves.” Thus, a business with great local potential just survives.

## The Colors of Ideals and How They Affect Strategy

Ideals come in various shapes and sizes.

Some limiting ideals include:

- **Culture-based ideals.** Ideals on how business works based on local businesses. Typically, most local businesses adopt a “me too” strategy where they basically copy the pricing and offerings of the competition. As more businesses do this, differentiation dilutes, and surviving ideas take place. So, we don’t see an open mind for innovation, just following the path of others because that’s how “it’s done.”

  On the other hand, some places, such as Silicon Valley, adopt an edgy innovation style, attaching AI to anything that can remotely look like a solution to a problem, Netflix-ifying any kind of business through a monthly subscription, and sometimes creating a solution that can revolutionize an industry—a status that only a handful of companies have achieved.

- **Misunderstanding the economy or understanding it “too well.”** Sometimes, lack of success is explained by external, uncontrollable factors. We see in the news terrible information on insecurity, high interest rates, and an old, long-established business going bankrupt along with some others. Then we believe we are in a tough economy, so we act accordingly. We limit spending budgets, limit testing marketing propositions and channels, and thus, business dwindles, and we get too close to becoming part of the alarming statistic.

- **Being a stickler for tradition.** Innovation with technology has changed every industry, from communications to industry-specific software to AI. Some business owners are laggards and don’t change unless they’re forced to.

- **Chronic mistrust of people.** Putting only family and friends in whatever roles, even if they’re unprepared, unskilled, and ironically, untrustworthy. Many drama stories come from trusting family members and friends beyond their normal scope. In a business, people are part of the machine. Either they make the machine work, or they don’t. If they don’t, either they can be trained and results improve rapidly enough, or they don’t. If they don’t, the business doesn’t benefit from their effort.

- **Build it and they’ll come.** This kind of ideal limits the business potential to feed itself only by osmosis, like a starfish laying down at the bottom of a not-too-deep sea feeding from whatever falls nearby. This means you get lucky by having a good location, a great domain name, or by being a social person and not needing too many sales to be profitable because, as a business, you don’t do any efforts to get buyers.

- **Tunnel vision.** Those who define their business as “I’m a personal trainer” get bounded by just suggesting an exercise routine, foods, and servings. A niche, although specific, has the potential to dominate a business category. The niche is only the perspective of how you’ll do it. Following the example, the category here is fitness or wellness, and there’s much more to it.

- **Centralization.** Not trusting anyone to make decisions and having them all come through you makes you a business manager, thus limiting a lot how to strategize to grow your business.

Some useful ideals are:

- **Small hinges swing big doors.** Focus on the smaller but critical strategies that can pivot (the right business model) or catapult (the right scale) your business forward and ahead of its own goals. Sometimes it can be a sales letter, sales page, having the best talent in the right places, or the right offer, the right proposition, and so on.

- **Funnel vision.** Take a growing and beating business category and see how you can funnel it to your business through your niche with as many and diverse fishing rods, casting nets, or trade.

- **Model instead of copying.** This means using one or more media channels to get attention and distribute it to your marketing funnels to generate business, and also join efforts with similar providers that can help you dominate your niche.

- **Strategy stack.** Strategies multiply each other. A great strategy in innovation can trampoline a strategy on being perceived as a leader in your field. This can benefit a strategy on getting public relations and other organic traffic, such as interviews.

- **Eagle’s view and external support networks.** There is such a thing as working “in” a business, working “on” a business, and working “above” the business.

  - **Working “in” a business:** Managerial work including planning, communications, resource allocation, contracts (both with employees and with clients), quality assurance, and supervising. Supervising is policing (sometimes literally, having someone checking bags to avoid petty theft), having cameras, inventory management (checking ins and outs of merchandise), coaching, and performance reviews. Internal auditing.

  - **Working “on” a business:** Doing strategic planning, having a strategic dashboard (more on this soon), stewardship by leadership, setting quality controls, organizational culture, innovation processes, and optimizing processes with training and technology. Auditing by a third party.

  - **Working “above” the business:** Business acquisitions, business horizontal expansions (geographical and/or wider demographics), vertical expansions (related offerings), optimizing and improving the business model through support networks (distributors, leveraging other people’s businesses, money, relationships, assets, time, propositions, and so on) and other external factors (favorable policies, incentives, tax benefits, licensing, public financing, and so on).

- **Decentralized.** One well-kept secret about effective business management lies in what the Germans call “hidden champions.” They are “unsexy” companies with rock-solid economics and constant growth. While Warren Buffet hates Ford and General Motors because these businesses can hardly make a profit, think about their part suppliers that these mega-companies don’t manufacture themselves. These suppliers get huge and stable contracts for years to come, are easier to manage since they don’t have to constantly look for new clients, and sometimes are even multinational companies themselves. These amazing companies tend to borrow from Prussian war theory. One of its main pillars is operational decentralization, meaning each branch manages itself without too much of a central HQ. This allows each branch to adopt local practices much easier, with minimal red tape. Many centralized companies fail miserably on this. For instance, as a Mexican, I often see advertising from American companies using machine translations, which is often terrible because many times their translators aren’t context-aware, and you get some weird phrases instead of having a decentralized local team. Even if you are not a multinational, allow the company to run decentralized, with each department their own; you only care about strategic results and your strategic planning. Micromanagement kills in a way that forces you to spend too much time on delegable details.

- **Change embracers.** People like Warren Buffett like to invest in companies where its durable competitive advantage is marked by their product not needing too many changes over time. Sadly, this is not the reality for many businesses. For instance, book publishers have had to adapt to offer digital versions and audiobooks after there was a technology shift in the book reading market, both in the book format and distribution channel. A digital download is immediately available.

## KPIs and OKRs

Strategy is a dish best served at the top of the hierarchy, relative to the strategy itself. If your strategy is to sell 10% more product each month, you not only need to be sure your ads, landing pages, and salespeople (if any) can handle the work, but also that you can get 10% more product each month to the customers without any issues. This means that the manufacturing, distribution, warehouse, and shipping teams can also handle the workload. Thus, a 10% increase in product sales basically touches the whole company.

You could also set the strategy to only the department. Say you know you can easily handle even twice as much product sales than you are currently handling, so the goal can be specific to the sales department.

To map strategy, a company developed in the late 80s The Balanced Scorecard, which has had three generations, the latest from the late 90s. Without delving too much into it, the map sets up four levels, and we’ll describe them briefly next.

1. **Learn and Growth.** To do it, you only have two options: improve skills and improve tooling.
2. **Processes.** Both skills and tooling from the previous point will improve process efficiency. Process efficiency will have two impacts: lowering costs and getting faster results.
3. **Clients.** From the second “output” from the previous point, faster results, then you’ll have less delay in serving them, which will lead to better retention.
4. **Financial.** From the first output from “Processes,” lowering costs, and having better retention from the previous point, you’ll increase profits.

As you can see, the Balanced Scorecard makes an easy map that ultimately just asks us two things: either improve abilities and/or improve tooling.

You can now see the missing skills you have to unlock the full potential in the level you’re struggling with or aiming to improve. For instance, copywriting will inevitably lead to more persuasive messaging, from emails, social media posts, comments, product pages, sales pages, customer service scripts, so copywriting will ultimately help you increase profits. Also, as you have efficient tooling to deliver such messages, such as an email marketing platform, a blogging platform, and/or an e-commerce platform, you can easily manage costs in the most efficient way for your business.

**What Can You Get from the Balanced Scorecard?**

See how your current strategic structure is and an ideal future structure. Use your understanding of the market, outline what rivals are doing right, and what fits better according to your Unique Sales Proposition, durable competitive advantage, and Company OS (the people’s structure, workflow, the teams’ strengths, weaknesses, attainable opportunities, and considering whatever threats limit your success such as poor location, poor social media strategy playbook, lack of sales follow-up, and so on).

Identify bottlenecks and weak points that limit progress; this may include talent, attitude, ideals, training, and tooling.

Define objectives based on these “areas of opportunity” (called Key Performance Indicators) that will help destroy these limitations.

Prioritize activities that allow a better flow in the strategic map.

Do checks and balances of the results and never get too comfortable with things going well; complacency is a toxic behavior that will make you slow and dumb in adapting strategy in the future.

With this, you’ll get every juice out of the Balanced Scorecard. You may have KPIs on all major areas for your business, say it’s Human Resources, Production, Distribution, Customer Service, Sales, and Marketing.

However, it is important to warn against having too many KPIs. Sometimes KPIs can work against each other. For instance, if you are struggling with lead generation and invest more, you might increase your customer acquisition cost. Another KPI might be to keep the customer acquisition cost lower than a certain threshold, so if you’re surpassing it, you have a conflict there. Which is more important?

**What About the OKRs?**

OKRs help visualize a short-term result that happens when your KPIs are working right. They can also answer why the Key Performance Indicator? They are objectives too, so they apply the SMART principles: specific, measurable, achievable, results-driven, time-bounded we initially looked at in the previous chapter.

It’s always easier to see with examples.

Now you have a complete strategic map that will help you steer your ship to focused goals. If you are overwhelmed by the amount of KPIs and OKRs possible for your small organization, just choose a handful of KPIs and OKRs that will help you stay focused. It doesn’t matter if you ignore the rest, as long as you aren’t having major issues with that department. Start with the most problematic ones. You can then re-strategize when you’re at a stronger position.

Choosing the right strategy matters a lot. In a competition game, like sports, that team that reads the game the best and chooses the best strategy wins. This means knowing what the key strategies your rivals are using are and choosing the right ones for your niche. From an innovative business model, decentralized management, pricing strategies, marketing approaches, and so on.
