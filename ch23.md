# Leading a Business Turned Company

A business is mostly an abstract word that simply refers to the activity of doing business. You can go to breakfast with an investor and do business right there.

A company is an organization legally constituted to perform a specified business activity. You will produce invoices from your company. Moreover, a company requires some kind of management system to help plan, organize, execute, and supervise your business activities.

Being a solopreneur is easy, management-wise. Even if you’re a small bunch of friends, like five or six friends, you can easily manage. But if you have more people working for you, then you need to define a few things to ensure that business operations go smoothly.

Unfortunately, as more people come into the picture, the communication matrix multiplies itself, and it is very easy to miscommunicate and get overwhelmed with so many people telling all kinds of stuff.

Then, it is important to define the organization map, who is in charge of what, who is responsible for what, and how progress and goals are measured.

Speaking about goals, you also need to define short-term goals and long-term goals. Break them into daily goals and see how each business unit performs, and take action when the outputs don’t add up to reach the long-term goals.

Goals should be S.M.A.R.T., meaning:

• Specific.
• Measurable.
• Attainable.
• Results-oriented.
• Time-bound.

A short-term goal should be time-bound to at most a year. Long-term goals go beyond. Similar to assets in accounting, there are current assets that are liquidated within a year and fixed assets that are to be liquidated over a year.

Let’s define some goals.

The basic business structure includes: leadership, human resources, sales, finance, and operations.

Let’s see a short-term and long-term goal of each as an example. All examples assume we are able to achieve them.

**Leadership:**

• Develop 3 profitable evergreen information products within a year.
• Get the brand known through at least two social media profiles with at least 50,000 followers or fans in 18 months or less.

**Human Resources:**

• Get a team of two video editors and a filmmaker that helps shape our products and social content in this current month.
• Attract 3 or more expert partners that help create quality content.

**Sales:**

• Validate demand through pre-sales pages and launch sequences with at least 500 organic or paid (as in paid ads) subscribers in 90 days.
• Have 1,000+ paying subscribers and 100,000+ fans in at most 18 months.

**Finance:**

• Average 200 new subscribers per month at the normal price in the next 8 months through the use of both paid media and social media promotions.
• Have profit margins averaging 50-60% with a 10% increase in the volume of sales for the next five years.

**Operations:**

• Put up one sales letter per month with 2 variations (3 total) and test them.
• Produce 3 pieces of high-quality content daily by our second year to grow fast and scale as projected.

## Don’t Ignore The Power Of Strategic Planning

Whenever I assess a client's business, much of their sales problems (usually it all starts there) derive from a lack of strategic direction, and we have to work on strategic planning to see what the ambitions and main goals are and, from there, derive objectives and a sense of purpose. This shows in a lack of direction, lack of objectives, a passive “you build it and they will come” attitude, terrible marketing funnels if any, and overall, a lack of ambition other than “we need to sell more, yurr!”

Businesses without strategic planning are like little kids in a toy store. They are aimless, wanting to see everything, choose the best suited for their current likes, and then quickly move on to the next toy. They don’t normally commit to a toy after it’s purchased. If you are a business owner with this kind of business, you won’t be much of a challenge against a focused leader in the era of multidimensional (virtual/physical, local/global) and multifactorial (competing USPs and competitive advantages, substitutes, secondary markets) competition.
